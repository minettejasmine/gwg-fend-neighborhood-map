## Instructions

Welcome to the Neighborhood Map React App project! The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the value of React for app development, including the use of multiple APIs for a map and input data. For this project, the application was created with `create-react-app` and `npm start` to get it installed and launched in the development environment.

## Purpose

Neighborhood Map project is a student requirement for completion of the Grow With Google Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) program. The purpose of the Neighborhood Map project is to illustrate the fundamentals of building an React app from scratch.

The React code had to be added to provide interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code. Good React design practice involves creating new JS files for each component and using import/require statements to include the components where they are needed.

## Requirements

To launch the application, install all project dependencies with `npm install`. Start the development server with `npm start`. In addition, a web browser is required. A text editor is needed to view the details of the code.

## Contributing

This repository contains code written by Minette J. Roberson. Because this Neighborhood Map App Project is the product of a GWG Udacity FEND Project,  pull requests will most likely not be accepted until further notice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This project includes data generated by a Google Maps API and a Foursquare API.
